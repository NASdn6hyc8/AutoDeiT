# AutoDeiT

**A NAS method for searching DeiT**

AutoDeiT is a method for searching the optimal DeiT architecture and its corresponding optimal knowledge distillation teacher model under parameter constraints.

## Our Trained Model/Checkpoint

### SuperDeiT

Our trained SuperDeiT weight is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/NASdn6hyc8/AutoDeiT/releases/download/model/superDeiT.pth), which can be used for searching and finetuning.

### Search Result

Our search result is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/NASdn6hyc8/AutoDeiT/releases/download/model/checkpoint-20.pth.tar), which contains the information of the final generation population from evolutionary search.

### SubDeiT

Our finetuned SubDeiT weight is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/NASdn6hyc8/AutoDeiT/releases/download/model/subDeiT.pth).
